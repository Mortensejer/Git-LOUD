LUA 6.2.16
LOUD_Misc 6.2.12
    
    - Resource Relocation will no longer do anything if NO AI are present in a game
    - The long standing T1 & T2 unit HP buffs (20% and 11% respectively) have been reduced to (12% and 6%)
    - game log will now report any units with misformed weapon range data
    - data streamlining and proper recording of the cheat driver values

    - AI DEBUG now has an option for tracking GUARDPOINT behavior
    - AI DEBUG now has an option for tracking WEAPON STATE changes (useful for debugging stalled weapons)
    - Weapon States, which could cause some weapons to shutdown during other weapons recharge phases, now fixed
    
    - MassPointShare, a value used by the AI to trigger stance change, lowered slightly for earlier aggression
    - MassPointList, which is a list of initial mass points, now directs Guardpoint thru the early game

    - AI Base radius adjusted down, should narrow base distress ranges
    - AI ACU Mass builder will now trigger at a lower point, allowing ACU to build early & replacement mass points
    - AI Outnumbered behavior now gets a very minor BuildRate boost
    - AI T1 Mass building engineers now 2 instances, instead of 1.
    - AI has minor revisions to shorten some of the early production queues for better economic response

    - BUFFFIELD structure changes allow removal of circular dependancies, and carry forward key data such as Radius and the VisualScale
    - BuffField blueprints for AEON Miasma field updated with new visual, slightly reduced range, increased consumption at top end

    - New Buff - MobilityPenalty, which will put a 4% mobility penalty on a unit - to be used in upcoming BO ACU revision
    - New Buff - ACU_T3_Intel_Package, which when used, gives most of the performance of a T3 OMNI station - to be used in upcoming BO ACU revision

    - revisions to the way buffs are done on ACU (multiples of the base rate now), small reduction in mass gained for top level engineering
    - this multiple method allows factional bonuses to come thru, resulting in a wider range of values for unit enhancements
    - mobility buffs will now appear briefly over units when applied, and whenever units take a mobility effect
    - errors with adjacency buffs being given to EngineerStations which were not eligible have been fixed
    
    - the unit 'orders' panel has been increased to 16 slots, from 12, for upcoming features
    - the presence of the 'Attack-Move' order is in place, but not yet functional
    - the Overcharge order will now always appear in the 4th slot - along with the other 'attack' orders
    
    - the unit 'details' panel will now more clearly show the actual regeneration rates after buffs, etc
    - as the buff happens, we record the updated regen on the unit, no longer needing to iterate the blueprint to find 'special' values
    
    - teleportation is now discounted by the amount of 'precharge' that units require
    - this effectively reduces the E required for any jump - especially for short ones.
    - the 'pre-charge' value is now relative to the amount of E storage that a unit may have (ACU)
    


### Release 12-08-2022

LUA 6.2.15

    - removed some redundant Campaign code (menus) and supporting modules that LOUD doesn't require
    
    - revised the 'Distress Response' for naval areas, will now properly evaluate HOVER units as threat and respond accordingly
    - Naval Rally Points and regular land-based Rally Points were interacting at ranges - land ones would overrule naval ones if found
        -- this was mostly an issue where a land base and a naval base or DP were in moderate proximity (less than 3k)

    - reviewed and revised all acceptable threat levels for engineer builds out in the open field to reduce suicidal engineer behaviors
    - looping engineers will now properly loop their mission if they break off a build due to threat, they'll find another suitable location (vs RTB)

    - LOUD will no longer build Experimental Artillery on 20k maps or smaller - this includes the Yolona Oss
    
    - minor change to how the ACU evaluates his condition when he has a shield (Einherjarn)
    
    - A revision to ALL air behaviors (Fighter, Bomber, Gunship & Torp) routines, making it more sensitive the long-range threats (threat modifier goes from .65 to .72)
    - revised the 'abort' routine for fighters (AirForceAILOUD) to widen the threat check radius while engaging a target (128 from 96)
    --   fighters should react better to being 'kited' over thick AA positions
    
    - revised the AI DEBUG option 'DistressResponseDialog' to give a more detailed report of DR activities by responding platoons    
    - revised the AI DEBUG option 'EngineerDialog' to give a more verbose trace of activities (great for finding issues, but VERY bulky in the LOG)
    --   for those wanting to learn about the AI process, this is an invaluable tool for seeing & tracking the processes a single engineer goes thru to build something
    



### Release 22-07-2022

LUA 6.2.14

    - fixed an issue with proper detection of amphibious presentations, resulted in overbuilding land-only units and restricted amphibious operations
    - fixed an issue with all 3 ratios where if the opponent loses all units (or doesn't build them) the respective ratio could drop to 0.011 (no enemy)
        -- this is directly opposite to the desired ratio of 10 (we've beaten the snot out of the opponent)
        -- greatly affects production choices (ie.- overbuild of ASF rather than going bombers/gunships)
    - initial air production has been revised to address all 3 opening needs (engineers, air scouts, air transport)
        -- dramatically restores his ability to move/expand quickly onto large maps and correctly identify opponents positions very early
    - PriorityFunctions, for the PlatoonFormManager (PFM), could reset builders with 0 priority (those to be removed), now ignores those
    - GUARDPOINT has a new option for PointSort -- MostThreat - allowing platoons to pick a point that is most threatened (useful for MEX Guard)
        - MostThreat is utilized by FindPointMeetsConditions() to sort the final point list by highest threat first
    - the MapLessThan20km function was using the wrong value (was not recognizing 20k maps properly)
    - AI Assist functions now have a higher default gating value (250M, 1250E) and will cycle on 3 second period, down from 4
    - AI SelfUpgrade function will now prioritize T3 Pgen Upgrades more aggressively than T2, but both have had their test frequency increased
    - A wide range of adjusted economic triggers for all kinds of engineer work (see Github for greater details)
    - A revised and narrower schedule of T4 builds, to encourage more assist of current projects, rather than starting more new ones




### Release 16-07-2022

LUA 6.2.13

    - fixed a divide by zero error affecting the strength ratio calculations
    - store intermediate cheat values (MinorCheatModifier, MajorCheatModifier) to be used elsewhere as modifiers 
    - air strength ratio now evaluating enemy bomber/gunships at full, allied only at half - this helps LOUD better identify enemy bomber/gunship concentration
    
    - added some new GUARDPOINT features to control point finding at short distances, and the use of MergePlanMatch during merge operations in that behavior
        -- allows guarding of points much closer to a base without false exit triggering
        -- allows tightly controlling merge operations so that they only merge with platoons that not only use the same behavior, but the same builder (ie. - MEX Guard)
        -- retreating platoons will still attempt free-range merge_into operations with almost any other platoon nearby
        -- fine tuning of most GUARDPOINT using formations, there were some whose base conditions didn't match with the builder data
        -- the MEX GUARD formation gets most benefit from this, and we have reviewed its formation sizes and priority, we should see him more actively guarding extractors
        -- the supporting FindPointMeetsConditions() function gets logging (outcommented) to allow detailed tracking of the filtering process
    
    - revised the SelfUpgrade process for more accurate trend prediciton, use of actual buildtime in the delay process, impacted by eco storage conditions
        -- process now ages older incomplete upgrades by slightly lowering trend requirements, making them more likely to pass eco checks as they age
        -- moving the upgrade requirement multipliers up, this stabilizes his economy at a higher point, which keeps factories running almost 100% of the time as result
        -- this was stressing him last week, as sometimes he couldn't transition into T3, resources were too tight - this patch should fix that nicely
        -- greatly improved the LOG dialog for Structure Upgrades, the AI logging funcion gives you detailed tracking of the decision process if you wish to see it at work
    
    - wide ranging additional eco and ratio conditions for engineer builds, assisting, factory production and land formations
    - adopting the 'outnumbered' approach to the initial naval base build - permitting a T1 engineer to start it earlier but with the minimal build
    - a full revision of SACU eco requirements for most of their builds, insuring that key decision points sit on similar eco conditions for more unpredictability
    - a revision of the eco requirements for adding new factories, he's a little slower in adding more, but this prevents premature eco crashing
    - mass fabricators will appear earlier and more agressively, and his drive to build power infrastructure will keep pace with this demand
    
    - alteration to the lobby code to track observers, and deal with observers causing a crash when exiting an ongoing game (unsuccessful)
    
    


### Release 09-07-2022

LUA 6.2.12

    - expanded functionality for both Assisting & LoopBuilding engineer, allowing fine control of economic parameters for break-off

    - using new assist functionality in AI assist energy tasks (ACU as well) permits more focused assisting for energy builds
    - a complete review on the focus of early power building - providing a more robust energy base for growth early in the game
    - mass building gets a full review as well, introducing some economic curbs on building more mass, especially tuned to the power systems
    - the economic triggers which allow many defense builders have been synced to those used by factories, but insuring continued unit production
    - engineers have been using 'attack-move' for several months now - this ability is now forced thru a field in the builder data - default is off otherwise
    - a flaw in the logic of LandStrengthRatioGreaterThan() was corrected (courtesy of Einherjarn)
    - T1 transports will no longer be built in advance - the builder will only be activated if a request has been made that could not be fullfilled
    - Walls will no longer grant kills towards veterancy




### Release 30-06-2022

LUA 6.2.11

    - Another hotfix for MetalWorld
    - MetalWorld now simulates 9 MEX for each original mass point - up from 5
    - Minor ACU behavioral change - ACU will keep his MEX building task all game now - corrected threat parameter
    - ACU T1 Pgen building will now continue - if needed - until T3 appears
    - Skirmish platoons (guards) have had their merge values slightly reduced, to keep more platoons in the field
    - Some of the Distress parameters have been adjusted - to reduce the response range - but respond to lower threat triggers
    - The CallForHelpAI parameters for MEX and HYDRO units - has had the threat trigger lowered from 3 to 1.5 (should pickup armed scouts, LABS)

    - some tweaks for base defense requirements, T1 defense reclaim will now collect walls
    - the odd 'disappearing decals' problem appears to be resolved
    - the LOG entries for ACT actions have been structured for consistency 

    - 1st pass of a new 'Teleport' mechanic
        - teleportation now has an 'optimal range' set in the unit blueprint (for those that can teleport)
        - teleports shorter or longer than the optimal range are less 'efficient'
        - maximum range is no longer entirely hard-capped but, for now, set at about X2 of previous values
        - teleport costs (and the time it takes to charge) will grow VERY quickly beyond optimal range
        - teleport charge time is now related to build power, rate capped just like in Evenflow - more build power == faster teleport
        - the 'burst' charge (about 4k E) is collected up front, before actually teleporting - no longer expended unless teleport works
        - at this time, that mechanic has NOT been applied to 'teleportation structures' - pending results
    
    - the 'Desync Detected' dialog will now completely suppress any additional onscreen indications if you select "Dont Show"

 |--> All categories are now folders.
 |--> Button to remove a key from an action without changing it to a different key.
 |--> Search for a key or action by name.

 |--> This has no effect on game performance or appearance, except for saving about 8 MB of RAM.
- Now that BrewLAN Baristas is under the "Miscellaneous" folder, its "UTIL" prefix is redundant, and has been removed.

 |--> Map-specific options previously fell under the "Advanced" header. This header is now called "Map Options" for clarity.
- All unit wrecks have 60% of their previous value to reduce penalization for aggressive play.
- Fix Unit Database (under Main Menu -> Extras) not having a background panel (and thus make it usable).
- The LOUD Standard button no longer enables Barista, Supreme Economy, Auto Mass Fab Manager and Sequential Mex Upgrade.
- Made the Sequential Mex Upgrade tooltip more accurate. Thanks to MostLostNoob#6672.
- AI: Engineers' sensitivity to nearby threat has been tuned. Threat must now be closer (400 <- 450) and larger (75 <- 30) to trigger most defensive land defence builders.
- AI: Moved the triggers for some engineer functions and several land formations based upon land ratio, keeping them in action a little longer.
- AI: Small increase in radius of base patrol (was running into the perimeter defenses).
- AI: Allowing T3 construction to continue to a slightly higher ratio and curbing T3 MML production at an earlier point.
- AI: A general reduction in the size of reinforcement platoons and the introduction of a SUPPORT reinforcement, to complement the DIRECTFIRE and INDIRECTFIRE platoons.

- Unit Database. Under Main Menu -> Extras, this is a screen that allows searching through and reading detailed information on all the units in the LOUD mod pack.
- BrewLAN RNG: Lucky Dip. A mod by Balthazar which, for each player, restricts the player from building all but one unit of any given type.
 |--> For example, out of the 4 Tech 3 Anti-Air units the UEF has, a UEF player will only be able to build 1.
 |--> Currently requires all of the unit mods included with LOUD as standard.
 |--> The LOUD port of this mod is in an alpha version, and subject to change. Feedback is appreciated as always.
- The economy of artillery has been overhauled. Energy consumption of artillery weapons is now formulaically derived from their damage and area-of-effect. This results in many weapons consuming more energy.
- Mild increases to energy storage for almost all energy related buildings, including mass fabricators. Seraphim buildings benefit more from these buffs.
- The fake UEF Tech 3 Sonar is no longer in the Seraphim unit roster as an upgrade to the Sera T2 Sonar. It has been replaced with BrewLAN's Sera T3 Sonar.

 |--> Cloaking now passively costs 275 energy per second.
 |--> All veterancy requirements multiplied by 1.4.
 |--> Damage multiplier versus shields reduced from 0.8 to 0.5.
 |--> Energy cost per shot increased from 0 to 24150 (drained at 2300 per second), resulting in a 10.5 second charge cycle before firing.

- Make AI build more shields when it is losing the land battle.
- Make AI build more AA when it is losing the air battle.
- Fixed issues preventing the AI from building any naval bases on 10km x 10km maps.
- Make the AI keep Tech 2 and Tech 3 production going longer if it is winning the land battle.
- AI: Some of the threat logic behind alerts and build conditions now factor in AI cheat multiplier, distance, and the AI's land ratio. 
- A triple wrench icon now indicates the build power statistic in the unit mouseover details.

### Release 18-12-2020 ###
Lua 5.3.30

- Automatic call of a console command to fix performance problems related to recent NVIDIA driver updates.
- AI multipliers can now be set via a text box.
- Time-based adaptive cheat can now work negatively, allowing an AI to become an easier opponent as the game progresses. This can make for a more potent early game -- when LOUD is normally most vulnerable -- while “levelling out” with players in the middle and later games, when LOUD’s advantages begin to add up.
- All the most advanced AI lobby options are now in their own category at the bottom of the list.
- Feedback-based adaptive cheat, when combined with time-based adaptive cheat, now works based on the current actual cheat instead of the cheat which the AI started with.

- New player colours: lime green, blue-grey, and gold.
- All darkest player colours lightened, along with greys.
- Maps which use unplayable areas no longer allow visibility or camera movement into these aforementioned areas.
- All Paragon counterparts now have the same ability list to reduce confusion.
- Unit rollover detail views now use title case when describing countermeasures in service of consistency.
- The AI now understands the difference between a map with water - and a map with water that allows naval units.
- The AI will now expand upon the map more aggressively to be more competitive with rushing players.
- The Small naval base will take precedence on smaller maps or those with a low percent of water area.
- AI: Some adjustments to maximum unit counts for various unit types.
- AI: Bombardment groups will now form at ratios of 1 or greater (down from 1.5)
- AI: Naval reinforcement requirements lowered slightly.
- AI: Improved air staging.
- AI: Improved reaction time of base distress responses.
- Base Alerts will prevent the Dead Base Monitor from closing a base until the alerts have expired. This was causing a fair number of alert units to get 'stuck' at a base that was closed during an alert.
- AI pings are somewhat less intrusive.
- AI: A very minor reduction in how much threat transport platoons will accept.
- AI: Some adjustment to bomber formations, requirements and targeting conditions, tether ranges, etc.
